# QREcon

The goal of QREcon is to be simple alternative to doing QR decomposition in R that is
intuitive and easy to use.

[![AppVeyor build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/jimb3/QREcon?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jimb3/QREcon)
[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/jimb3/QREcon.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jimb3/QREcon)

## Installation

You can install the released version of QREcon from [github](https://github.com) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jimb3/QREcon")
```

## Example

This is a example showing how to use QREcon returning a list:

```{r example1}
## example returning a list with Q and R
library(QREcon)
# matrix to perform QR decomposition on
x <- matrix(c(1.,1.,1.,2.,3.,5.), 3, 2)
# call to QR decomposition routine
qr <- QREcon(x)
# view result, if q and r are NUll decomposition failed
qr
# checks if result is correct
# should be x
qr$q %*% qr$r
# should be identity matrix
t(qr$q) %*% qr$q
```

This is a example showing how to use QREcon when result in stored in matrices passed to the routine:

```{r example2}
library(QREcon)
# same matrix as in other example
x <- matrix(c(1.,1.,1.,2.,3.,5.), 3, 2)
# allocate memory for q and r
q <- matrix(0., 3, 2)
r <- matrix(0., 2, 2)
# call QR decomposition routine
QREcon(x, q, r)
# display q and r. Should be same as above.
q
r
```
