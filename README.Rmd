# QREcon

The goal of QREcon is to be simple alternative to doing QR decomposition in R that is
intuitive and easy to use.

## Installation

You can install the released version of QREcon from [github](https://github.com) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jimb3/QREcon")
```

## Example

This is a basic example showing how to :

```{r example}
## example returning a list with Q and R
library(QREcon)
# matrix to perform QR decomposition on
x <- matrix(c(1.,1.,1.,2.,3.,5.), 3, 2)
# call to QR decomposition routine
qr <- QREcon(x)
# view result, if q and r are NUll decomposition failed
qr
# checks if result is correct
# should be x
qr$q %*% qr$r
# should be identity matrix
t(qr$q) %*% qr$q
```
